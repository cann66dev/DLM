# DLM (Dark Lives Matter)
  Dark styled system elements.

  It hooks UIView and CALayer at a high level, and intelligently changes colors. This works fairly well, and results in high    compatibility.

# Supported iOS Version
  10-10.3.3

# Note
  I know it supports old versions because old devices are still in use
  so I made a tweak considering them.
